features:
  - |
    This version adds support for using more than one ATOS HSM in High
    Availability mode.  There is a new variable `atos_hsms` that accepts
    a list of HSM IP addresses and associated Certificates.  See
    `vars.yaml.sample` for an example.
deprecations:
  - |
    Two variables have been deprecated: `atos_hsm_ip_address` and
    `atos_server_cert_location`.  You should use the new `atos_hsms` list
    to specify these values instead.  See `vars.yaml.sample` for an example.
